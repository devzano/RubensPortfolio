      <p>This Privacy Policy explains how the Sunshine Key West Challenge app handles your information.</p>
      <p>We do not collect or store any personal data from users. The app may request limited permissions, such as access to your device’s location or photos, to enable certain features. For example, images downloaded through the app may be saved directly to your device. These permissions are optional, and no personal information is shared with third parties.</p>

      </ul>

      <h2>Collecting and Using Your Data</h2>
      <p>The Sunshine Key West Challenge app does not collect or store any personal data on its own servers or databases.</p>
      <p>However, the app may request access to certain device features in order to provide a better user experience. These include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Location:</strong> If you choose to enable location access, it is used to show nearby event-related features, such as maps or nearby recommendations. Location data is never stored or shared externally.</li>
        <li><strong>Photos and Media:</strong> If you choose to download images from the app, they are saved directly to your device’s photo gallery or file system. This action does not involve uploading or collecting any data.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>All permissions are optional and controlled through your device settings. You can enable or disable access at any time.</p>

      <h3>Use of Your Data</h3>
      <p>The Sunshine Key West Challenge app does not collect, process, or share any personal data.</p>
      <p>Any permissions you grant—such as access to location or storage—are used solely to support optional features within the app and are not used for tracking, analytics, or marketing purposes.</p>

      <h3>Retention of Your Data</h3>
      <p>The Sunshine Key West Challenge app does not retain any personal data. Since we do not collect or store your information, there is nothing to retain on our end.</p>
      <p>Images downloaded through the app are saved directly to your device and remain under your control.</p>

      <h3>Transfer of Your Data</h3>
      <p>The Sunshine Key West Challenge app does not transfer any personal data because we do not collect or store such information.</p>
      <p>All downloaded content remains on your device and is not uploaded or transmitted elsewhere.</p>

      <h3>Deleting Your Data</h3>
      <p>The Sunshine Key West Challenge app does not store any personal data, so there is nothing for us to delete on our end.</p>
      <p>If you’ve downloaded images or allowed location access, that data remains on your device and can be managed or removed directly through your device settings or gallery.</p>

      <h3>Disclosure of Your Data</h3>
      <p>We do not collect or store any personal data, so there is no information to disclose to third parties, law enforcement, or other entities.</p>

      <h3>Security</h3>
      <p>Because the Sunshine Key West Challenge app does not collect or store personal data, there is no risk of your information being exposed through the app itself.</p>
      <p>Any images saved through the app or permissions granted (like location access) remain local to your device and are subject to the security of your device and operating system.</p>
