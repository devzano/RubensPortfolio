      <div>
        <h2 className="mb-2 text-lg font-semibold text-slate-100">3. Data &amp; Security</h2>
        <p>
          The Application stores and processes personal data you provide to deliver the Service. You are responsible for
          securing your device and access to the Application. Jailbreaking or rooting your device may compromise security

      <div>
        <h2 className="mb-2 text-lg font-semibold text-slate-100">4. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>The Application may rely on third-party services that have their own Terms and Conditions, including:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc space-y-2 pl-6 marker:text-sky-400">

        <h2 className="mb-2 text-lg font-semibold text-slate-100">5. Connectivity &amp; Charges</h2>
        <p>
          Some Application functions require an active internet connection. The Service Provider is not responsible for lack
          of Wi-Fi, data availability, or related charges, including roaming fees. If you are not the bill payer for your
          device, you confirm you have permission from the bill payer to use the Application.

          You are responsible for keeping your device charged and in good working order. While the Service Provider strives

          losses resulting from reliance on Application functionality or content.

          its use at any time. Upon termination, your rights under these Terms end and you must cease use and, if necessary,
          delete the Application from your device.
