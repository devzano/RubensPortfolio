# Ruben Manzano â€” Portfolio

Personal site showcasing my work across iOS, React Native, and web. Highlights include **Watchlistr**, **RecipeRealm**, **Steda**, **EchoExpense**, **Starship Pixelscape**, and more.

**Live site:** [https://rubenmanzano.com](https://rubenmanzano.com)

## Highlights

* **Polished case studies** with rotating screenshot grids and concise feature summaries.
* **Interactive background UFO** (Three.js) that gently roams, follows/taps, and supports themes per project page.
* **Fast & responsive**: App Router, image optimization, font streaming, and lightweight UI.
* **Clean navigation** with modal routes (intercepted) for privacy/terms pagesâ€”no jarring page loads.
* **SEO & social cards**: full Open Graph/Twitter metadata + Apple web app settings.

## Stack

* **Framework:** Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript
* **UI:** Tailwind CSS, next/font (Geist & Geist Mono)
* **3D/FX:** Three.js (custom UFO background component)
* **Images:** next/image with responsive sizes
* **Routing:** Parallel/intercepted routes for modals (`@modal/(...)page`)
* **Misc:** Accessible modal with focus trap & portal to `#modal-root`

## Notable bits

* **UFO component**

  * Modes: `roam`, `follow`, `swoosh`
  * Props: theming (`body`, `cockpit`, `ring`, light colors), `disableInput`, and `shipSize` (`small | medium | large`)
  * Runs behind content (`position: fixed; pointer-events: none; z-index: 0`)

* **Modal system**

  * SSR-safe: renders only after mounting and uses a single `#modal-root` in `app/layout.tsx`
  * Scroll-friendly: backdrop/page scroll and internal card scroll for long content
  * Accessible: focus trap, ESC/Backdrop close, ARIA labelling
